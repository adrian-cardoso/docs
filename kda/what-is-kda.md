# What is KDA?

## What does the KDA token do?

KDA is a digital currency that is used to pay for compute on the Kadena  blockchain. Similar to ETH on Ethereum, KDA on Kadena is the manner by which miners are compensated for mining blocks on the network and is the transaction fee that users pay in order to have their transactions included in a block.

## What is Kadena’s token economic model?

Kadena has designed a token economic system that aligns the incentives of all participants. As Kadena is a public blockchain platform, the main allocation of coins is distributed through mining. There is a genesis block with allocations to investors, contributors, and the platform reserve. The rest of the coins are created as mining rewards.
